This is a simple version of cricket written in C++.
1. There are two teams: TeamA and TeamB, each having 3 players and the game consists of two innings.
a.) Each inning is of 6 balls (one over) where, one batsman from the batting team will bat for 6 balls and one bowler from the bowling team will bowl 6 deliveries
b.) One batsman from the batting team and one bowler from the bowling team is selected randomly for each inning. TeamA will always bat first which means TeamB will always bowl first.
2. In each delivery, runs are scored from 0 to 6. There is no criteria to get wickets. In simple words, once a batsman starts his inning, he bats for all the 6 balls without getting out/dismissed/retired hurt etc.
3. After completion of two innings i.e. after each team has done batting, scored runs will be compared to decide the winner or to decide if there is a tie.
